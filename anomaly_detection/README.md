## Anomaly detection was used on two different datasets.  

## The first dataset was a log history in a school's curriculum.  Comparisons were made by each class and one class's students were analyzed, including curriculum access after graduation, which led to an interesting find.

## A request log history was analyzed as well.  This dataset included a rather large request, a request from another country, and two odd methods.
