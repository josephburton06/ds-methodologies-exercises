## This repo is for project and course work completed while at Codeup.  Python was used as the scripting language.  Data was obtained through SQL databases, web scraping, and API's.  Different methodologies were applied based on the goal of the project.

## Examples of projects include:

## Classification was used to model customer churn predictions of a telecommunications company.  It's very important for a company to be able to predict their at-risk customers.  

## Clustering was used to group similar home sales using the Zillow dataset.  Regression was then used to predict the log error for each observation.

## Time Series Analysis was used to forecast future store sales.  Data was gathered from an API for this project.  

## Time Series Analysis was also used to predict Fitbit data.  The subject's history was analyzed through various methods.  Through this, insights into the subject's life were able to explained and visualized.

## Anomaly Detection, and other methods, were used to identify anomalies in the log history of school curriculum.  Data was obtained through an API, cleaned, visualized, and then analyzed.
